# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another account that is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce card fraud.

Credit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes a payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised, where the account holder does not provide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party.
